Seismo-VLAB
===========

**Seismo-VLAB** is a simple, fast, and extendable C++ multi-platform finite element software designed to optimize large-scale simulations of dynamic, nonlinear soil-structure interaction (SSI) problems. It has the vocation to share academics researches in structural and geothecnical field but also for industrials, students, etc.
